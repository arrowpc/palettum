  Palettum is a color remapping tool for images and GIFs.<br>
  It lets you apply any custom palette by either snapping each pixel to its closest color (ideal for pixel-art styles), blending the palette as a filter for a smoother effect, or both.

## Installation
 > [!NOTE] 
 > Unfinished

macOS:
```bash
brew tap arrowpc/palettum
brew install palettum
```

If your system/package manager wasn't listed, you can install the precompiled binary from [releases](https://github.com/arrowpc/palettum/releases).

## Building the Project

If you want to build the project from source, follow these steps:

### CLI

To build the command-line interface (CLI) tool, run the following Cargo command from the project root:

```bash
cargo build -p palettum-cli
```

The executable will be located in the `target/debug/` directory (or `target/release/` if you add the `--release` flag).

### WebAssembly (WASM) for Web App

The web application uses a WebAssembly module compiled from the Rust code.

1.  **Build the WASM package:**
    Run the build script from the project root. This script compiles the Rust code to WASM and places the necessary files into the `web/src/wasm/pkg` directory.

    ```bash
    ./build-wasm.sh # won't work on windows, script content will be moved to package.json scripts soonâ„¢
    ```

2.  **Set up the web frontend:**
    The web frontend is located in the `web/` directory and uses Bun.

    *   Navigate to the web directory:
        ```bash
        cd web
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        bun install
        ```
    *   Run the development server:
        ```bash
        bun run dev
        ```
